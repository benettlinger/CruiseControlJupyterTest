    "### Version 0-Beaglebone\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook contains two parts: (a) a simulated cruise control module (CCM) and (b) a vehicle model (VM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCM takes in vehicle speed and desired setpoint and outputs an accelerator pedal position (APP). The VM takes in APP and outputs an incremental change in vehicle speed. This interaction becomes a loop which runs at 10Hz. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicle used in this model is a Class 6 Freightliner truck with road load coefficients found here: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/64610.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The cruise control module settings can be configured by the user. These include the Kp and Ki terms, (+) and (-) slew rates, speed differential at which the CCM shuts off, and integrator time constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "APP and APP_Tx are intentionally separated. APP_Tx is the value written to an outgoing CAN message. APP is a number used within Jupyter. They are separate because the vehicle model should read APP from the CAN bus and not a variable within Python. The same is true for kph and kph_Tx.\n",

    "\n",
    "Version 0-BeagleBone: Same as version 0, but with matplotlib functions removed. Used on the Beaglebone/debian\n"
